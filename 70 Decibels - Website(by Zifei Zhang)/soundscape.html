            A quiet room is, on average, 27 dB. While freight trains may be
            infrequent, they can peak at around 120 dB. That dramatic change (or
            high levels of noise intermittency) are associated with
            cardiovascular disease.

            Noise pollution produced by airplanes above 45 dB have been
            associated with adverse health effects, according to the World
            Health Organization. While visiting the airport to get to your next
            big destination can expose you to these loud noises, living by major
            airports like LAX means over 1500 disturbances everyday.

            Jackhammering might be one of the most irritating sounds to wake up
            to in the morning. The noise pollution it creates does not interfere
            with sleep as much as other factors. Most cities have laws
            surrouding construction times, usually requiring workers to start
            work after 8 or 9AM. Despite this, the clangs and bangs are enough
            to sabotage concentration.

            Similar to the freight train, the intermittent disturbances that a

            train tracks, however, each passing train could be a roaring
            disruption or another note in the hum of the city.

            On average, highways and railroads have the same average decibel
            level of 55 dB, however, the rumble of the road stays steady
            throughout the night. Nonetheless, loud noise exposure can lead to
            problems related to stress, high blood pressure, speech
            interference, hearing loss, sleep disruption and lost productivity.

            Music festivals have become a ubiquitous part of the urban landscape
            during the summer months, however, they are a major source of
            unregulated and harmful noise pollution. Some festivals like

            as damage to park grounds, displacement of youth sports teams,
            festival goers trashing nearby streats, and increased traffic
            clogging access to nearby hospitals.
