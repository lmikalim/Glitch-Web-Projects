    <h2>
      dance of strangers
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      when in the room, when you work, when you sleep, when you change clothes
    </p>
    <p>
      You are never more than seven feet away.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      you don't know much about your roommate. Your roommates name is [blurred out]
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What is your name?
    </p>
    
    <p>
       You wake up groggily for class. Your roommate is already awake, sitting upright on the computer. It is 7AM. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You return to take an online call. Your roommate is a lump under the covers. It is 1PM.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You do work on your computer. Your roommate is watching social media on the bed. It is 4PM.
      
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You turn off the lights to sleep. Your roommate fell asleep a few hours ago. It is 10PM.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You wake up and the room is dark, the blinds left closed. Your roommate is absent. It is 8AM.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You return to pick up a forgotten notebook. Your roommate is sitting on the bed, taking a call in a language you don't understand. It is 12PM.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You do work on your computer. Your roommate is absent. It is 10PM
      
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You go to bed, and remember to close the blinds. Your roommate is absent. It is 12AM.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You wake up and awkwardly get dressed as quietly as you can. Your roommate is asleep. It is 8AM.
    </p>
    <p>
      You return and the room is quiet and still. Your roommate is not home. It is 1AM.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then it switches to roommates point of view, mirroring other response.
