          To make an account for that website, you actually didn't have to
          input your email, however the design of the window, and the choice to
          make the 'skip this' option a very small, unassuming link, might've
          lead you towards thinking it was required. This is forced action.

      <h2>But it's just my email...</h2>
      <div class="center-margin">
        <h3 class="hidden-paragraph">
          While giving away your email address may seem unassuming, it is in
          fact essential data, that you should try to share thoughtfully.
          Advertisers now use email data to track your habits and behavior
          across different platforms to generate specifically targeted
          advertising.
        </h3>

        <h2 class="hidden-paragraph">
          "if you’re wondering why you are continuing to see relevant ads
          despite the rise of privacy tools that combat digital tracking, it’s
          largely because you are still sharing your email address."
