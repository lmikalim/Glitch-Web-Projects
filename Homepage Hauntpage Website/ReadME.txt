homepage hauntpage is a narrative experience based around a 
simple premise: becoming trapped within a website. From this 
starting point, I wanted to create a journey that feels a 
bit like solving a puzzle, where routes lead to dead ends 
and back to the starting point as the user tries to find 
a way out(or through) their online confinement.  It's odd,
hopefully fun, and engages with the idea of the web being 
a kind of home/house for the contemporary user, that similarly,
can become "haunted". I wanted for it to start off very
unassuming, with a fake Vox-esque web article. However,
after clicking into a mysterious link, the user is unable 
to return to that original article, and is now stuck 
looping around to the new 'homepage'.
