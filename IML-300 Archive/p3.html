     I was first introduced to dark patterns in 2016, via a short video essay I had arbitrarily chosen to watch on YouTube. Since then, the landscape of UI/UX design has changed drastically, and similarly, dark patterns have only continued to evolve. While the internet has been an endless source of creative inspiration and unique social interaction, it’s sadly become less and less of a free space from the reach of advertising and commercialization. With the commercialization of the web comes much more malignant, and deceptive patterns aiming to trick users out of their money, data, and time. This deception has a direct effect on especially new and inexperienced internet users, such as children and the elderly, who are especially susceptible to these patterns. Entering a web environment with a constant fear of being tricked undermines, to some degree, the key freedom of navigating the endless web, and I wanted to create a tool that easily demonstrated dark patterns, allowing viewers to play-test these interactions with dark patterns so they’d be prepared to identify these patterns in the wild, and hopefully navigate the web with much more confidence and freedom.
