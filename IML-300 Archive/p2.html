      homepage hauntpage is a narrative experience based around a simple premise: becoming trapped within a website. From this starting point, I wanted to create a journey that feels a bit like solving a puzzle, where routes lead to dead ends and back to the starting point as the user tries to find a way out(or through) their online confinement.  It's odd, hopefully fun, and engages with the idea of the web being a kind of home/house for the contemporary user, that similarly, can become "haunted". I wanted for it to start off very unassuming, with a fake Vox-esque web article. However, after clicking into a mysterious link, the user is unable to return to that original article, and is now stuck looping around to the new 'homepage'.
