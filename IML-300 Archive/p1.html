      There's been a trend recently of linking the coo of the mourning dove(a bird natively endemic to the majority of the United States) to childhood nostalgia. I think it's very lovely that in Los Angeles, an increasingly urban city, that people have still grown up with this poignant connection to nature. In thinking about this online phenomenon, I wanted to compile a few other birds commonly found in the Los Angeles area(note these birds are common, not necessarily native to the land) who's sounds could possibly elicit this same nostalgic response. It's odd how many native Angelenos don't attribute this connection to the nature of the city until they lose it, either by moving away from the city, or spending time in spheres that distance them from natural environments. I think it's a bit pretentious to say I hope this digital space can even begin to replicate the powerful memories and connection that these birds can have to people, but I'd hope that just be entering into this experience, viewers are encouraged and revitalized to reconnect to nature, striving to understand and learn as adults.
