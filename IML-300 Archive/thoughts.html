  Women in Web Art
    </h1>
      <p>
        In “Cataloguing Change: Women, Art, and Technology” author Melanie Lenz surveys the contributions of female artists to the development of Computer Art. Despite the evolving landscape of technology that defined each of the prominent examples, there seemed to be a consistent sense of abstraction and geometry in many of the pieces. This could be credited to the level of technicality needed to create each piece; The article lists multiple examples of artists programming custom software to develop unique works. With the artist being very intimately involved in the technology behind the art, it seems that the final works and the motifs of pixilation, geometric shapes, and vectors come to reflect and celebrate the technological aspects of the production.

  GUI
    </h1>
      <p>
        American Artist's Black Gooey Universe seems to include a universe of ideas in understanding Interface and the visual world of computing. What struck me the most was the focus on how active design choices for computing interfaces ultimately could reflect the societal norms of an era. I think the choice of early computing giants like Apple to create stark white backgrounds as part of the GUI, which abstracted and distanced from the technicality of computing seems initially understandable- computers were rising in public use and had to seem nonthreatening to the public. However, as computers have cemented themselves as an essential aspect of contemporary life, it's seemed more and more necessary to return to design that breaks the dichotomy of user vs. programmer. The everyday person should not just be a passive user, and benefit from interacting more critically with the way a computer works. It seems more and more necessary for technology literacy and basic coding skills to be essential curricula for contemporary education since computing stretches its arms into so many disciplines and aspects of life.

  Early Web
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      Personally, the most poignant insight from this week's reading was in Jenny Oddell's How to Internet, on how the Internet's primary and seemingly most long-lasting appeal is in simply connecting people, "Remembering this installation now, it suggests that what is magical in telecommunications is not the machinery itself, but the voice that is heard, or the face that appears on the other side". Oddell's article strongly leans into a sense of nostalgia and loss over a younger, more experimental, and seemingly more charming internet full of these quirky experiences centered on connecting to other people, now discouragingly replaced by advertising and overly sanitized content. I feel that this is definitely true, that with the growth of the internet's popularity, branding and the desire to sell and distribute information less thoughtfully has grown, but I feel that it doesn't mean newer generations have any less access to unique, human experiences on the web.
Oddell has a specific focus on the very beginning of the internet and the awkward frontier of early video/website content and experiments, which I think ultimately still do exist, albeit much more hidden from public view. Growing up I remember friends being fascinated with Omegle, a 2009 chat website allowing users to text and call with complete strangers(which in hindsight seems a massive safety concern for children to use...), Radio Garden, which would allow users to listen to livd radio in different parts of the world in different eras of time, and so, so many odd art experiments that could be found through The Useless Web, a website that would randomly send users to one of these experimental sites. Recently I found myself spending an hour scouring a website called Queering The Map, where users explore a world map dotted with messages left by queer folk internationally, as a way of saying, "even here, we exist". It's all very poignant and feels like a reminder that these unique, genuine sites still exist past the early Internet age.

      Surveillance
    </h1>
    <p>
      In watching Lauren McCarthy’s Eyeo talk, I was struck by the concept of
“Home” is used to guide the presentation, especially when thinking about surveillance. There’s a unique contrast between projects like Follower, which seems polarizing for its participants and definitely far from comforting, and her work with crafting accessible and open-source coding opportunities. I’m especially drawn to how making coding spaces that are open to beginners and adapted for historically underrepresented communities in tech, she’s able to make a kind of digital home for learning and creative experimentation. The phrase she used to describe going into p5js was “uncertainty as a starting point”, which I feel is especially apt for creating these spaces. As the public’s access to tech learning has grown, I feel that there’s been a degree of expectation now for a certain level of fluency with online functionality/coding. However while coding may be becoming more accessible to most people, there’s still a gap to bridge especially for people with disabilities, limited access to technology, etc., and I think it’s still necessary to create spaces for first-time coders. If viewing surveillance as observation, then perhaps this is a more positive side of being aware of others on the web - being able to indiscriminately see those often neglected in systems of education, especially for tech.

      Poor Image
    </h1>
    <p>
      Hito Steyerl’s essay “In Defense of the Poor Image” was a work that surprised me with how impactful resolution, a seemingly overlooked aspect of digital media, could become when evaluated through a much more critical lens. I was strongly drawn to the idea that low-resolution images are representative of ultimately, the interconnected freedom of the internet. In the introduction, Steyerl touches briefly on the idea that low resolution can be an artifact of the constant distribution of images, which to me felt somewhat poignant. In the same way, digital photographs wear down, gain smudges, worn-down edges, or sun-bleached colors,  digital images can similarly break down. They can interact with degradation, and the passage of time, which I feel contrasts the idea of digital immortality many people see in web-based art. I think another effect of the poor image that Steyerl also touches on is the way in just the degradation of quality, the narrative of an image changes. This week, I know our class has a focus on meme images, and I’ve found meme images are usually much more funny when the quality and resolution are lower, and if not, at the very least they have a sense of charm to me. I like looking at a funny image and seeing the low quality, maybe some overlapping and now indecipherable watermarks(hooray for digital piracy!) and thinking of all the other people and all the joy this image has brought them.

      Algorithmic Bias
    </h1>
    <p>
      Joy Buolamwini's TED talk on algorithmic bias is an accessible example and starting point when dealing with the widespread issue of machine bias. Oftentimes people are quick to treat technology as inhuman and divorced from human bias, when in actuality algorithms tend to recreate the same biases as people as a result of learning from biased datasets. I think the most striking part of Buolamwini's story is how she observed the exact same biases internationally, speaking to how international the problem is. With the quick availability of data is a new network to export and share biases.  I appreciated that Buolamwini included very straightforward and actionable next steps for treating the diagnosed problem, which started from the experiences of those discriminated by machine bias. 

How do these same biases manifest in different aspects of computing, like speech recognition? I'm wondering whether this bias is stronger in different areas of computing, whether data is universally biased, or if there are certain areas that bias is concentrated.

      Nonviolent Code
    </h1>
    <p>
      I really liked Olivia Ross' introduction on Non-Violent Code, especially in the way that it's so mindful of computing as a sum of its many parts, whether it be physical servers to the special metals used in electrical engineering. I think, similar to other featured artists in this course, Ross emphasizes the importance of contemporary coders understanding the physicality and structure of computing, rather than just understanding the aesthetics experienced with a GUI. 

Furthermore, I think the attention to the language used in describing aspects of computing, like Ross' evaluation that terms like "mining data" imply exploitation is similarly essential to more conscious coding. I wish Ross had gone into more detail about the effects of this language on a greater scale but to be fair this is just an introduction to setting guidelines for coding.  it reminded me of a semi-recent(?) switch in language with git, where the primary branch is being changed to be called the 'main' branch, rather than the 'master' branch by providers like GitHub, as the language was derived from the concept of a 'master and slave'.

      Omni-Specialized Design
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      I enjoyed Ari Melenciano's talk on Omni-Specialized design, and I felt that one of the points emphasizing working with rather than for communities as a creative/designer was very important, especially as creative students. I think it's easy to feel a sense of self-importance in being able to synthesize and fabricate ideas, and it's easy to get carried away with self-centered, and especially human-centered projects when as a creative our work can serve communities. I think it's an interesting connection because as I've progressed through arts/film education one of the most consistent notes of advice from people in the industry has been to look outside one's creation and turn towards collaborative processes to make work.  In my Modern Literature & Thought class, we spoke about perspectivism, which I feel is a succinct way of explaining the issues with the trend toward individualistic/self-centered design work. Ultimately our singular perspective limits, no matter how much we try, our understanding of the world and others, and by broadening the creative staff behind any project, we can strive towards creating work that serves people at a more universal scope.

      Multisensory Art & Disability
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      Christine Sun Kim's "The enchanting music of sign language" TED Talk expresses how social currency interacts with the medium of music and sound, and works to dispel myths about the ability needed to work through with these currencies and mediums. Her closing remarks note that deaf people can make music, and hearing people can learn sign language, encouraging people across the hearing spectrum to interact with mediums outside of their usual fields of reference. I think in particular what was most striking was the way that Kim visualized music and sign language through her visual arts pieces, using expressive curving lines that captured the flow of motion of her hands and arms. I think the talk could be applied on a greater level to the interactions of different senses/abilities/ways of experiencing the world and encourages creating works that play with personal interpretations of the world through different modalities.
